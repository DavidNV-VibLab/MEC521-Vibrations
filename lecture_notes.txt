COURSE DESCRIPTION 
 
(Mechanical) Vibrations is one of the first courses where students apply the knowledge of 
mathematics, calculus and basic engineering sciences including statics, dynamics, solid 
mechanics and fluid mechanics to solve practical problems. Solution of practical problems 
in vibrations requires Mathematical Modeling of the physical system. One frequent 
application of the principles of Vibrations can be found in Engineering Design. 
 
This course emphasizes understanding of the fundamental concepts of vibrations. It begins 
with free vibration of single-degree-of-freedom for undamped and damped systems 
followed by forced vibration with harmonic excitation. Multi-degree-of-freedom systems, 
equations of motion and solution methods are introduced after which the determination 
of natural frequencies and mode shapes are further explored. The course concludes with 
the understanding of continuous media vibrations. 
 
COURSE OBJECTIVES 
 
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to: 
 
[CO1] Apply the concepts and fundamental principles of vibration to mechanical 
systems. [PO1, PLO1]{C2} 
[CO2] Analyze and solve wide range of simple and complex vibration related problems. 
[PO2, PLO2, PLO7]{C4} 
[CO3] Evaluate complex vibration related problems using available techniques. [PO3, 
PLO2, PLO6]{C5} 
 
COURSE FORMAT 
 
This course is conducted as a combination of lecturers, tutorials and demonstrations 
wherever necessary. The course content will be delivered on a blended-learning mode in a 
topical fashion during the lecture hours while theories and quantitative areas will be 
reinforced via tutorial sessions. Students are expected to invest about 3 hours per week for 
self-study. Please refer to the “My BL Approach” document at the Padlet space for this 
course-group for a better understanding of this learning strategy. Student-centered learning

1.1 The Study Of Vibration 
 
Engineering systems possessing mass and elasticity are capable of relative motion (from a 
reference state). If such motion repeats itself at given interval of time, the motion is known as 
vibration. The study of vibration is concerned with oscillatory motions of bodies and forces 
associated with them hence application of engineering mechanics. Vibration occurs in a wide 
range of engineering systems (refer Figure 1 & 2 below) and often regarded as an undesirable 
by-product of the system concerned (why?). The equation of motion of the system concerned 
is often derived via idealization of the system using the mass-spring-dashpot terms, which 
represents the body, elasticity and friction of the system, respectively.

1.2 Terminology 
 
(a) 
What is Vibration? 
 
Vibration may be considered as an oscillating motion of a particle or body about reference 
position (equilibrium position). The motion can be periodic, random or transient. 
 
It can be perceived from different perspectives as given below: 
 
• 
The periodic motion of a body or system of connected bodies produced by its displacement 
from equilibrium position i.e. x as a function time, t; x(t). 
 
• 
An interchange between the potential energy and kinetic energy storage of a system that 
produce a cyclic or oscillating motion of the system. 
 
• 
The natural period of vibration of a system can be utilized to determine the type of loading 
(i.e. static or dynamic) exerted on the system.  
 
• 
Any objects that possess mass and elasticity are capable of vibrating.

Basic Elements of Vibration Waveform 
 
v   FREQUENCY 
- 
Denoted by the symbol f and measured in units of Hertz (Hz). 
- 
Audible range: 20 Hz to 20 kHz. 
- 
Time for one complete cycle @ oscillation, T is the reciprocal of its 
frequency, f,  i.e. 
  
 
NATURAL FREQUENCY      
 
All systems possessing mass and elasticity are capable of free vibration. Of primary 
interest for such systems is its natural frequency of vibration. The failure of major 
structures such as bridges or airplane wings is an awesome possibility under resonance 
conditions. It is therefore important to calculate the natural frequency of the vibration 
system under investigation. 
 
v    MAGNITUDE / AMPLITUDE 
- 
Denoted as A. 
- 
Depends on the expression of interest e.g. displacement in mm, velocity in 
mm/s and acceleration either as m/s2 or g where 1g = 9.82 m/s2.

Measurements of Vibration 
 
There are 3 basic expressions i.e. measurable quantity, which could be used to define vibration 
as follows: 
 
(a) Displacement, x(t) 
(b) Velocity, v(t) 
(c) Acceleration, a(t) 
 
These expressions are related through the process of differentiation / integration as illustrated 
below.

The mathematical description of these expressions can be formulated based on the

expressions.

Peak Value, Mean Value and RMS Value 
 
§ 
The peak value of a vibrations measurement reflects the maximum stress that acts on the 
vibrating object. This value also indicates the spatial constraint of the oscillation. 
 
§ 
The mean value of a vibrations measurement represents the equilibrium value such as that 
for a DC level of an electric current. The mean value is given as: 
 
 
 
For instance, the mean value a full sin wave (A sin(t)) is zero meanwhile for the mean value 
for a half sin wave is: 
 
                                    
               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.4. Mean Value of a Rectified Half Sine Wave 
 
 
§ 
The root-mean-square (RMS) value is related to the squaring of the displacement values of 
the vibration and generally represents the energy content of the oscillation process. The 
RMS value is given by:

Measuring Vibration in Decibel Units 
 
Decibel is a measuring unit, which is based on logarithmic scale, frequently used in vibration 
measurements (be it displacement, velocity or acceleration). It is defined as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These equations show that the (vibration) power is proportional to the square of amplitude or 
voltage. The first power of amplitude or voltage can be measured in dB units using this 
equation: 
 
Þ 
 
 
Since decibel is based on logarithmic scale, the addition or subtraction process should also be 
executed logarithmically.

1.3 Mathematical Modeling: The Basic Rules 
 
Solution of an engineering problem often requires mathematical modeling of a physical system. 
The modeling procedure usually starts from problem identification. The system to be modeled 
is abstracted from its surroundings and the effects of the surroundings are noted. Known 
constants and variable parameters are identified. Assumptions are made to simplify the 
modeling. When assumptions are used, an approximate physical system is modeled. The actual 
system behavior may be somewhat different than that predicted using mathematical model. 
Basic laws of nature such as conservation of momentum apply to all physical system. 
Application of geometric constraints in the form of kinematic relationships is often necessary.  
After the mathematical solution is complete, the results are formulated. Physical 
interpretation of the results is an important final step in the modeling procedure.

Modeling of a Simple Harmonic Motion 
 
Oscillatory motion may repeat itself regularly or display considerable irregularity. When the 
motion is repeated in equal intervals of time, t, it is called periodic motion. The simplest form 
of periodic motion is harmonic motion, which is shown in Figure 1.6. If the periodic motion is 
a function of time, x(t), it must satisfy the relationship: x ( t ) = x ( t + t ). Hence, repetition of 
the waveform at fixed intervals, time for one complete cycle. The repetition time, t, is called 
the period of oscillation, and its reciprocal, f = 1 / t is called the frequency. The relation between 
the frequency of vibration, f and angular frequency, w (also called angular speed) of a vibrating 
object is given by:

If the angular frequency of the line designated as w  (= 2pf) and measured in radians per second, 
rad/s, and the displacement x (usually in mm) is: 
 
 
                                                           x = A sin wt

where A is the amplitude of the vibration, measured from the equilibrium position.

1.4 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) and Generalized Coordinates 
 
The number of degrees of freedom (DOF) for a system is the number of kinematically 
independent variables necessary to completely describe the motion of every particle in the 
system. It represents the number of mode(s) or manner the system could vibrate i.e. the 
geometric constrain. In other words, DOF tells the number of independent coordinates required 
to completely define the geometric location of the masses involved.

By attaching the base to the body whose motion 
is to be measured, the vibration pickup will be 
able to measure oscillatory motion of the body. 
This is possible by finding the relative motion 
of the base and the mass. Hence, only one 
coordinate 
is 
needed 
to 
specify 
the 
configuration of the system.

1.5    Classification of Vibrations 
 
Oscillatory systems can be broadly characterized as: 
 
§ 
Linear System – (predictable response, linear parametric relations) 
§ 
Non-linear System – (involves non-linear analysis to predict the system response) 
 
There are two general classes of vibrations:  
 
§ 
Free Vibration  
 
Occurs when a system oscillates under action of forces inherent in the system itself, 
and when external impressed forces are absent. The system under free vibration will 
vibrate at one or more of its natural frequencies, which are properties of the dynamical 
system established by its mass and stiffness (elasticity) distribution.  
 
(Periodic motion observed as the system is displaced from its static equilibrium 
position) 
 
§ 
Forced Vibration  
 
Occurs when external forces excite a system. The system is forced to vibrate at the 
oscillatory, excitation frequency. If the excitation frequency coincides with one of the 
natural frequencies (harmonics) of the system, a condition of resonance is encountered 
(dangerous, large oscillations). 
 
(External force(s) acting upon the system during its vibratory motion. In forced 
vibration, the system will vibrate at its natural frequency as well as to follow the 
frequency of the excitation force.) 
 
 
PERIODIC MOTION 
 
Some vibrations are composed of several different frequencies simultaneously. For instance, 
the vibration of a violin string is composed of the fundamental frequency, f and all its harmonics 
2f, 3f etc. Such vibrations result in a complex waveform, which is repeated periodically. French 
mathematician, J.Fourier (1768-1830) showed that any periodic motion could be re-presented 
by a series of sines and cosines, which are harmonically related. (Kindly refer to the attachment  
“Chapter 1 Supplement: The Fourier Series”).

TRANSIENT VIBRATION   
 
A transient vibration is non-continuous. It occurs: 
 
§ 
Due to impact, or  
§ 
During the starting up of a motor, or 
§ 
Anywhere that the exciting force is not continuous.  
 
The transient vibration has a spectrum with many “lobes” that would contain a whole range of 
frequencies. Refer to Figure 1.9.

CHAPTER 1 SUPPLEMENT: THE FOURIER SERIES 
 
Any repeated motion can be represented as a series of sinus and cosines that are harmonically 
related. If x(t) is a piecewise continuous function of period t, then the Fourier series 
representation for x(t) is: 
 
x(t) 
= 
 
 
= 
 
 
 
            ……..(C1.1) 
 
By way of manipulating 
 or 
 on both sides of the above equation and then 
integrating them for time range of t, the coefficients an, bn and ao can be obtained. We will 
obtain first these equations: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0; if m ¹ n 
Þ 
     = 
 
 
 
 
 
 
; if m = n 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0; if m ¹ n 
Þ 
     = 
 
 
 
 
 
 
; if m = n 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0; if m ¹ n 
Þ 
     = 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0; if m = n 
 
 
It can be seen that all terms in the right hand side of the equation C1.1 is zero except if m = n, 
therefore it can be concluded that:

2.1.1 Definitions 
 
(a) 
Single Degree-of-Freedom 
 
If a system is constrained in order that it can vibrate in only one mode or manner, or if only 
one independent coordinate is required to specify completely the geometric location of the 
masses of the system in space, it is a single DOF system. 
 
(b) 
Free Vibration 
 
Free vibration is the periodic motion observed as the system is displaced from its static 
equilibrium position. No external force is acting towards the system during the motion. The 
forces acting are the spring force, the friction force and the weight of the mass, which are all 
intrinsic in nature relative to the system of concern. Due to the presence of friction, the vibration 
will diminish with time. The vital aspect of analysis in this sub-section is the determination of 
the natural frequency of the system, in two distinct environment i.e. undamped and damped 
vibration. 
 
The following three types of free vibrations are important from the subject point of view: 
 
(i) 
Longitudinal Vibrations 
-  Particles of the shaft or disc move parallel 
to the axis of the shaft as shown in Figure 
2.1(a). In this case, the shaft is elongated 
and compressed alternately. (What are the 
stresses induced in this case?) 
 
Examples: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Figure 2.1(a) 
 
(ii) 
Transverse Vibrations 
-  Particles of the shaft or disc move 
approximately perpendicular to the axis of 
the shaft as shown in Figure 2.1(b). In this 
case, the shaft is straight and bent 
alternately. (What kind of stress is induced 
in this case?) 
 
Examples: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Figure 2.1(b) 
 
 
(iii) 
Torsional Vibrations 
-  Particles of the shaft or disc move in a 
circle about the axis of the shaft as shown 
in Figure 2.1(c). In this case, the shaft is 
twisted and untwisted alternately. (What 
kind of stress is induced in this case?)

2.1.2 Equation of Motion (Newton’s Second Law of Motion) 
 
The mass-spring system is the most convenient vibrating system to be modeled as shown in 
Figure 2.2 below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.2. A Simple Mass-Spring System: Deriving the Equation of Motion using the Free-
Body-Diagram Method / Newton’s Law of Motion. 
 
 
Newton’s Second Law of Motion can be used to obtain the equation of motion of the mass as 
follows: 
 
 
 
SF   =    ma 
Þ 
 
ma   =    SF  =  w - k(D + x) 
 
:  
a   =   
 
 
Since  kD = w = mg, therefore,  m
   =  - kx 
Þ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
………(2.1) 
 
The choice of the static equilibrium position as reference (datum) for x has eliminated w, the 
force due to gravity, and the static spring force kD from the equation of motion. The definition 
of natural angular frequency, wn , is: 
 
 
    
 
 
 
           
  
 
 
 
………(2.2)

Exercise 2.1 
 
Show that 
, if the static deflection, D, is measured in mm. 
 
 
 
Using this definition, equation (2.1) can be written as, 
 
         
 
 
 
             ………(2.3) 
 
Þ

Equation (2.3) is a second order differential equation that is linear and homogen. The 
generalized solution for this equation is: 
 
            
                               ………(2.4) 
 
 
where the  integral constants A and B can be determined from the boundary conditions, 
 
and 
. Substitution of A and B into equation (2.4) to yields:

2.1.3 Energy Method 
 
For a conservative system, the total energy of the system is constant at all time and the equation 
of motion can be derived using the principles of Conservation of Energy (Basic Law of Nature). 
For a system that vibrates freely without damping, the energies involved are the potential 
energy and kinetic energy. Recall that the kinetic energy, K.E. or T is possessed by a mass that 
is moving (with a velocity) while the potential energy, P.E. or U, which is stored in the form 
of strain energy, is obtained via either elastic deformation or work done on a gravitational field. 
 
If the total energy of the system is expressed as potential and kinetic energy, the following is 
true: 
 
T + U   =  constant   
 
 
 
 
             ………(2.5) 
 
Þ 
    
 =  0 
 
Based on equation (2.5) or its time rate of change, the equation of motion and natural frequency 
of the system under consideration can be determined. 
 
 
2.1.4 Rayleigh’s Method 
 
Also, based on the energy conservation principles, the following equation is written to obtain 
the natural frequency of the system in a straightforward manner. 
 
 
Þ 
         T1 + U1  
=    T2 + U2 
 
 
 
 
             ………(2.6) 
 
 
If the sub-script 1 refers to the static equilibrium position of the mass (please refer Figure 2.1 
above), then  U1   =  0, and if the sub-script 2 refers to the position of maximum displacement 
(upward), then  T2  =  0.  
 
 
Position 
K.E. (T) 
P.E. (U) 
Static Equilibrium 
Maximum level 
 
Maximum Displacement 
(upward) 
Minimum level (= 0) 
 
 
 
 
If the system undergoes harmonic motion, then T1 and U2 are the maximum values for kinetic 
energy and potential energy, respectively. Hence, 
 
 
(K.E.)max  =  (P.E.)max  =  Total Energy of the System 
 
 
This is known as the Rayleigh’s Method. The resulting equation will readily yield the natural 
frequency of the system.

EXAMPLE 2.1 
 
In the mass-spring system shown in Figure 2.3, prove that the reduction in potential energy of 
the mass as it is displaced from the static equilibrium is constantly replaced by the equivalent 
work of spring. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.3. Mass-Spring System and the Spring Force-Extension Plot 
 
 
Solution 
 
ENERGY METHOD (to determine the equation of motion) 
 
By selecting the static equilibrium position as the reference, the potential energy of the mass at 
this point is zero. By a displacement of x from this position, the increase of the spring’s strain 
energy is determined from the area below the line of the Force-Extension Plot in Figure 2.3.  
 
Þ 
mgx  +  
 
 
The loss of potential energy of the mass caused by the displacement x (downwards) is –mgx. 
Therefore, the net change in the potential energy of the system is 
. If this amount of 
energy is added to the kinetic energy of the mass, the resultant energy is a constant as follows: 
 
Þ 
  +  
  =  constant. 
 
Differentiating this equation yields,

2.1.5 Damped Response 
 
So far, we have been discussing about the free vibration of undamped systems and their 
characteristics. Based on ideal conditions, the vibrating motion of a system repeats itself 
infinitely with time (no change in characteristics!). However, under realistic conditions, for 
instance, the vibration of a simple pendulum system shown Figure 2.6 above will diminish in 
amplitude (comes to rest) after several full oscillations. This occurs as a result of natural 
resistances (such as?), which the system has to overcome, whereby the internal energy of the 
vibratory system is utilized.  
 
When there is reduction in amplitude over every cycle of vibration, the motion is said to be 
damped vibration. Thus, in damped vibrations, the amplitude of the resulting vibration 
gradually diminishes. This is due to the fact that a certain amount of energy possessed by the 
vibrating system is always dissipated in overcoming frictional resistance to the motion. The 
frictional resistance posed to the motion of the body can be caused by various factors: 
 
(i) 
The medium in which the vibration takes place (air, fluid etc.). 
(ii) 
Internal friction. 
(iii) 
The (external) dampening element(s) that is attached to the system. 
 
In vibrating systems, the effect of friction is referred to as damping. The damping provided by 
fluid resistance is known as viscous damping. A dashpot is a mechanical device that adds 
viscous damping to a mechanical system. A linear viscous damping component has a force-
velocity relation of the form, 
 
Þ 
         F   =    c.v  
 
 
 
               
             ………(2.7) 
 
where c is the damping coefficient of dimensions mass per time (force per unit velocity). 
 
Consider a vibrating system, as shown in Figure 2.7, in which a mass is suspended from one 
end of the spiral spring and the other end of which is fixed. A damper is provided between the 
mass and the rigid support.

Step ! :  Developing the Equation Of Motion 
 
The forces involved in the motion of a mechanical system as shown in Figure 2.7 can be 
individually expressed on the elemental basis. There are three elements in the system shown 
i.e. spring, damper and mass.  
 
Spring force on the mass acting in opposite direction to the motion of the mass, 
 
 
Þ 
Fs   = 
k.x 
               
               
 
 
             ………(2.8) 
 
 
 
Based on Equation (2.7) above, the damping force (frictional force) on the mass acting in 
opposite direction to the motion of the mass is given by, 
 
 
Þ 
Fc   = 
               
               
 
 
             ………(2.9) 
 
 
which shows that the frictional motion of the body is directly proportional to the speed of the 
movement. 
 
Accelerating motion on the mass acting parallel to the motion of the mass, 
 
Þ 
Fm   = 
              
 
 
               
           ………(2.10)
 
               
 
Hence, the equation of motion is, 
 
Þ

   +   k.x    =

This is a second-order differential equation. A system described by this equation is said to be 
a single DOF harmonic oscillator with viscous damping.

Step " :  Solving the Equation 
 
The usual form of solution for Equation (2.11) can be written as: 
 
Þ 
x 
= 
est 
 
 
 
= 
cos s  +  j sin s 
 
 
 
By differentiation and substitution, Equation (2.11) becomes, 
 
 
 Þ 
(ms2  +  cs  +  k). est   
= 
0 
 
 
 
The equation above is termed characteristic equation that has two roots: 
 
 
Þ 
 
= 
  
 
 
           ………(2.12) 
 
 
 
Therefore, the general solution for Equation (2.11) is, 
 
 
 
Þ 
x 
= 
  
 
               
           ………(2.13) 
 
 
 
where the coefficients A and B can be determined from the boundary  (or initial) conditions 
x(0) and 
. 
 
 
Substituting the values of s1 and s2 into Equation (2.13) yields, 
 
 
Þ 
x(t) 
= 
       ………(2.14) 
 
 
Three significant consequences in aspects of motion may arise from Equation (2.14) due to the 
relative values of the damping term, (c/2m)2, and the elasticity term, k/m. They are: 
 
(i) 
critical damping,  
(ii) 
under-damping and,  
(iii) 
over-damping.

2.1.5.1 Critical Damping 
 
If the damping term, (c/2m)2, is equal  to the elasticity term, k/m, i.e., 
, according 
to Equation (2.12), the radical (i.e. the term under the square root) becomes zero and  the roots, 
s1 and s2, are identical. This is a case of critical damping.§   
 
 
From this condition, the natural angular frequency could be determined as follows: 
 
 
Þ 
      ………………..(we have shown earlier that  
) 
 
 
Therefore, critical damping coefficient (variable) is written as, 
 
 
Þ 
  
 
 
 
 
           ………(2.15) 
 
 
The critical damping coefficient, ccr, is the amount of damping required for a system to be 
critically damped. It is more convenient and relevant to state the damping coefficient in 
Equation (2.15) in a dimensionless form called the damping ratio (also, damping factor): 
 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
 
 
              
 
 
In general, the damping ratio is the measure of the relative amount of damping in the existing 
system with that necessary for the critical damped system. Therefore, 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
Subsequently, the roots given by Equation (2.12) is summarized as: 
 
 
Þ 
  
 
 
 
 
           ………(2.16) 
 
§ The critical damping is said to occur when the frequency of damped vibration (fd) is zero (aperiodic 
motion). This type of damping causes the mass to retreat (move back) rapidly to its equilibrium 
position in the shortest possible time. (Refer Sub-section 2.1.5.1 below for theoretical details).

It has to be noted that all of the three specific damping cases aforementioned depends on the 
damping ratio. Critically damped type of vibrations occurs when 
, which yields the root 
values, s1  =  s2  =  -wn. This is consistent with the earlier statement based on Equation (2.12). 
 
 
For this case, the equation of motion is,

2.1.5.2 Under-Damping 
 
If the damping term, (c/2m)2, is lesser than the elasticity term, k/m, i.e. 
, according 
to Equation (2.12), the radical becomes negative, producing complex conjugate roots. This 
scenario is known as under-damping (also, small damping). The resulting form of the radical 
is, 
 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
For this case, the damping ratio, z < 1.0, therefore, 
 
 
Þ 
 
=

It is proved below that the term 
in Equation (2.20) is equivalent to the circular 
(angular) damped frequency of the system, 
, (which is physically different compared to the 
natural frequency,
, of the same system under undamped condition). Therefore, one can see 
from Equation (2.20) that the motion of the mass in under-damping condition is Simple 
Harmonic with damped angular frequency, 
, and amplitude, 
, which diminishes 
exponentially with time. The typical response of under-damping case is illustrated in Figure 
2.9.

Determining the Angular Damped Frequency 
 
 
For the sake of mathematical calculations, assume the following: 
 
 
, 
 
 
 
 
Þ 
     = 
 
 
 
 
 
     
=

= 
 
 
 
 
 
        ………(2. 21b) 
 
 
The damped vibration period, td, is related to the angular frequency of the damped vibration, 
wd by the following equation: 
 
 
Þ 
 
= 
 
 
 
 
 
=

2.1.5.3 Over-Damping 
 
If the damping term, (c/2m)2, is greater than the elasticity term, k/m, i.e. 
, the 
values of the exponent in Equation (2.14) i.e. the roots, s1 and s2, are real but negative. For this 
case, the damping ratio, z, > 1.0. 
 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
Thus, one of the roots will increase while the other will decrease with time depicted in Figure 
2.10. This scenario is called over-damping and consequently, vibratory oscillations do not 
occur. The mass moves slowly to the equilibrium position. This motion is known as aperiodic 
(no frequency). When the roots are real, the most general solution of the differential equation 
is, 
 
Þ 
x(t) 
= 
 
 
 
The constants A and B is given by the initial conditions as follows: 
 
Þ 
A 
= 
 
 
Þ 
B 
=

2.1.6 Logarithmic Decrement 
 
Logarithmic decrement is defined as the natural logarithm of the amplitude reduction factor. 
The amplitude reduction factor is the ratio of any two successive amplitudes on the same side 
of the mean position, as illustrated in Figure 2.11 for which the response is given by Equation 
(2.20) above.

decrement of successive amplitudes. 
 
 
If x1 and x2 are successive values of the amplitude on the same side of the mean position, then 
the Amplitude Reduction Factor is,

The Logarithmic Decrement of the amplitudes of x(t) is given by: 
 
Þ 
 
= 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
           ………(2. 24) 
 
 
Since the amplitude value of the sin wave is equal (repeats itself) for each time difference of 
one complete oscillation, Equation (2.24) can be simplified as: 
 
Þ 
 
= 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
  
 
 
 
 
          ………(2. 25) 
 
 
Substituting the value of the damped vibration period, td, given by Equation (2.22), into 
Equation (2.25) yields, 
 
 
Þ 
 
= 
 
 
 
 
 
          ………(2. 26) 
 
 
 
If the magnitude of  
  is extremely small that

Introduction 
 
This chapter deals with the analysis of forced vibration of single DOF systems caused by single 
frequency (harmonic) excitation. Forced vibrations of a 1-DOF system occur when work is 
being done on the system while the vibrations occur. Examples of forced excitation include the 
ground motion during an earthquake or the motion caused by an unbalanced reciprocating 
machinery component or the motion of the machine itself. These excitations may not be desired 
for machineries that require undisturbed operation (example?) or for reasons pertaining to the 
structural safety when the vibrations amplitude is amplified to the insupportable limit. The 
effects of resonance in structures must be avoided and this is often achieved by using suitable 
dampers or absorbers. Transient vibrations analysis is also briefly explored at the end of the 
chapter. 
 
 
3.2 
Harmonic Excitation and Differential Equations 
 
Figure 3.1 illustrates the model development for forced vibration of a linear single DOF system 
with viscous damping when a linear displacement is chosen as the generalized coordinate. 
Application of Newton’s law to the FBDs shown in Figure 3.1(a) lead to the differential 
equation governing the motion of the model system of Figure 3.1(b) as follows:

Therefore, the single frequency excitation has the form: 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
 
                      ………(3.2) 
 
where FO is the amplitude of the excitation, w, is its angular frequency and y, is its phase. 
 
 
Substituting Feq(t) from Equation (3.2) into Equation (3.1) yields another form of the 
differential equation of motion of the system; 
 
Þ 
  
 
 
           ………(3.3) 
 
 
Dividing Equation (3.3) above by meq leads to the standard form of the differential equation of 
forced vibrations (of a linear, single DOF system): 
 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
 
           ………(3.4) 
 
 
The general solution of Equation (3.3) or the standard form as in Equation (3.4) is the sum of 
the homogenous solution (i.e. the solution obtained if the right-hand side is set to zero) and 
the particular solution (depends on the form of Feq(t)). The presence of the homogenous 
solution in the general solution leads to an initial transient motion (virtually caused by 
undamped vibrations), which quickly decays. This is followed by steady-state response of the 
linear system, which depends on the particular solution. 
 
 
At this juncture, kindly take note of the following points: 
 
§ 
The frequency of the excitation is independent of (or NOT affected by) the system’s 
natural frequency.  
§ 
The nature of forced vibrations is that the system of concern will be forced to vibrate 
at the excitation frequency. 
§ 
The differential equation governing forced vibrations of a single DOF system can be 
derived by the FBD method. (Equivalent systems method is also applicable as well.) 
§ 
The excitation forces are non-conservative (could be transformed to other possible 
forms of energy during or after excitation).

Figure 3.3 Response of an undamped system to a single-frequency harmonic excitation when 
wex < wn. 
 
 
3.3.1 
Resonance 
 
The response curve provided in Figure 3.3 is the sum of two trigonometric terms, wex < wn, 
hence of different frequencies. But if wex = wn, then the case is special. The response of a system 
in which the excitation frequency equals the natural frequency grows without bounds, as shown 
in Figure 3.4. This condition, where the amplitude increases unlimitedly, is termed resonance. 
However, in a real physical system, the amplitude is bounded. In many cases, as the amplitude 
grows, assumptions (such as?) used in modeling the physical system become invalid.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.4 Undamped response when excitation frequency coincides the natural frequency of 
the system. The response grows without bound producing resonance. 
Resonance is an important concept in the study of undamped forced vibration!

For instance, in a system with an elastic element (example?), the proportional limit of the 
spring’s material is eventually reached. After this time, the motion of the system is governed 
by a non-linear differential equation reflecting the non-linear force-displacement relation (i.e. 
Hooke’s Law) of the spring. 
 
For a system such as pendulum in which small displacement assumption (
) is used 
to linearize the governing differential equation, the assumption becomes invalid when 
resonance occurs (q  is great). The original non-linear differential equation must be used in the 
case of resonance analysis.  
 
Resonance is a dangerous condition in a mechanical or structural system and will produce 
unwanted large displacements or leads to failure. Resonance can also lead to unwanted large-
amplitude vibrations in machinery. 
 
 
Case Study  
 
Background 
 
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the third largest suspension span bridge in the world and 
opened with much fanfare on July 1, 1940. The center span, measuring 2,800 ft, stretched 
between two 425 ft high towers, while the side spans were each 1,100 ft long. The suspension 
cables hung from the towers and were anchored 1000 ft back towards the riverbanks. The 
designer, Leon Moisseiff, was one of the world’s foremost bridge designers. He and his partner 
Fred Lienhard had earlier developed the calculations for determining load and wind forces used 
by bridge designers everywhere.  
 
Cause of the Disaster 
 
Resonant torsional oscillations were partially the cause of the famous Tacoma Narrows Bridge 
disaster (refer Figure 3.5). It is suspected that the frequency at which vortices were shed from 
the bridge coincided with a torsional natural frequency, leading to oscillations that grew 
without bound. Recent investigations revealed that non-linear phenomena resulting from 
improper installation may have also played a role in the disaster.

3.3.2 
Beating 
 
When vibrations of a conservative system are initiated, the motion is sustained at the system’s 
natural frequency without additional energy input. Thus, when the frequency of excitation is 
the same as the natural frequency, the work done by the external force is not needed to sustain 
motion. The total energy increases because of the work input and leads to a continual increase 
in amplitude.  
 
When the frequency of excitation is different from the natural frequency, the work done by the 
external force is necessary to sustain motion at the excitation frequency. 
 
When the excitation frequency is close, but not exactly equal, to the natural frequency, an 
interesting phenomenon called beating occurs. Beating is a continuous buildup and decrease of 
amplitude as shown in Figure 3.6. When vex is very close to vn and 
and y = 0, 
Equation (3.8) becomes: 
 
 
Þ 
            ………(3.9) 
 
 
From Equation (3.9), since 
 is small, the solution can be viewed as a cosine wave 
with a slowly varying amplitude. The period of the amplitude is called the period of the beating 
and equals 2p /
. The period of vibration is 4p /
.

The amplitude and phase angle provide crucial information about the forced response. Better 
qualitative interpretation of the response could be obtained by formulating Equations (3.11) and 
(3.12) in non-dimensional form. It is noted from these equations that, 
 
Þ 
X  =  f(FO, meq, wex, wn, z), and 
 
f  =  f(wex, wn, z). 
 
Three basic dimensions are used in these parameters i.e. mass (meq), length (X) and time (w).  
 
Multiplying Equation (3.12) by 
 (or dividing Equation (3.11) with k) gives: 
 
Þ 
 
 
 
           ………(3.15) 
 
 
and 
 
 
Þ 
 
 
   
 
         
                       ………(3.16) 
 
 
where   
 
 
 
   
 
         
                       ………(3.17) 
 
is termed as the frequency ratio. 
 
 
The ratio 
 
 
M = 
 or 
 
 
 
is dimensionless (check it out!) and called the amplitude ratio or magnification factor. It can 
be taken to mean as the ratio of the amplitude of forced response to the amplitude of excitation. 
However, a more direct physical interpretation is that of the maximum force developed in the 
spring of a mass-spring-dashpot system to the maximum value of the exciting force. Thus, the 
non-dimensional form of Equation (3.12) is:

These equations show that the non-dimensional amplitude (X) and phase (f) are functions of 
the frequency ratio, r and damping ratio, z. The magnification factor as a function of frequency 
ratio for different values of damping ratio is shown in Figure 3.8 below. These curves are called 
frequency response curves. The frequency response curves shows that the damping ratio has 
great influence on the amplitude and phase angle especially in the vicinity of resonance 
frequencies (i.e. r = 1).

Case I:  r << 1  [Figure 3.9(a)] 
 
The inertial element (mass) and damping element are small, producing small phase angle, f. 
The magnitude of the external force, FO and elastic force, kX is almost identical. 
 
 
Case II: r = 1   [Figure 3.9(b)] 
 
The phase angle for this case is 90°. The damping force equalizes the increment of the inertial 
force. The magnitude of the force, FO is greater than the dampening force, cwX. The value of 
the amplitude at resonance (wex = wn) can be obtained from Equation (3.15) as follows:

Further Details And Explanations 
 
Apart from the information obtained from Figure 3.9 above, the following details applies to the 
frequency response curves as shown in Figure 3.10 below: 
 
§ 
M = 1 when r = 0 
In this case, the excitation force is a constant and the maximum force developed in the 
spring of a mass-spring-dashpot system is equal to the value of the exciting force. 
 
§ 
M à 0 when r à ¥ 
In this case, the amplitude of the forced response is very small for high-frequency 
excitations. 
 
§ 
For a given value of r, M decreases with increasing z. 
§ 
For 0 < z  £ 1/
, the maximum value of the magnification factor occurs for a frequency 
ratio of 
 
Þ  
  
 
 
 
 
           ………(3.20) 
 
Equation (3.20) is obtained from Equation (3.18) by determining the value of r such that 
dM/dr = 0. 
 
§ 
The corresponding maximum value of M is, 
 
Þ  
 
 
 
 
 
           ………(3.21)

§ 
The forced response and the excitation force are in phase for z  = 0. For z > 0, the response 
and excitation are in phase only for r = 0. 
 
§ 
If z > 0 and 0 < r < 1, then 0 < f  < p /2.  
The response lags the excitation as shown in Figure 3.12. 
 
§ 
If z > 0 and r = 1, then f  = p /2. If y = 0, then the excitation is a pure sine wave while the 
steady-state response is a pure cosine wave.  
The excitation is in phase with the velocity. The direction of the excitation is always the 
same as the direction of motion. 
 
§ 
If z > 0 and r > 1, then p /2 < f  < p.  
The response leads the excitation as shown in Figure 3.13. 
 
§ 
If z > 0 and r >> 1, then f » p. The sign of the steady-state response is opposite to that of 
the excitation. 
 
§ 
If z = 0,  
r < 1: the response is in phase with excitation.  
r > 1: the response is p radians out of phase (f  = 180°) from the excitation.

EXAMPLE 3.1 
 
A machine of mass 25.0 kg is placed on an elastic foundation. A sinusoidal force of magnitude 
25 N is applied to the machine. A frequency sweep reveals that the maximum steady-state 
amplitude of 1.3 mm occurs when the period of response is 0.22 s. Determine the equivalent 
stiffness and damping ratio of the foundation. 
 
 
Solution 
 
The system is modeled as a mass attached to a spring and dashpot in parallel with an applied 
sinusoidal force of magnitude 25 N. For a linear system, the frequency of response is the same 
as the frequency of excitation.  
 
Thus, the maximum response occurs for a period of

WORKSHEET (3.1) 
 
A machine part of mass 2 kg vibrates in a viscous medium. Determine the damping coefficient 
when a harmonic exciting force of 25 N results in resonant amplitude of 12.5 mm with a period 
of 0.2 s. If the system is excited by a harmonic force of frequency 4 Hz, what will be the 
percentage increase in the amplitude of vibration when damper is removed as compared with 
that with damping.

Forced Response / Damped System / ROTATING UNBALANCE 
 
Forced vibration of rotating machinery is often caused by unbalanced rotation of its components 
(or elements). The machine of Figure 3.14 has a component that rotates at a constant speed, w. 
Its center of mass is located a distance, e, called the eccentricity, from the axis of rotation (the 
mass center do not coincide with the axis of rotation. The mass of the rotating element is, say, 
m, while the total mass of the machine (system) is M. The motion of the machine is constrained 
to one DOF vertically (why?). The acceleration of the rotating element relative to the machine 
is mew2 directed from the mass center of the element to its axis of rotation (center point). Since 
the location of the element’s mass center changes as the element rotates, the direction of the 
element’s acceleration also varies. The FBD shown in Figure 3.15 below indicates the external 
forces in action as well as that experienced internally by the system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.14 Rotating unbalance produces harmonic excitation whose amplitude is 
proportional to the magnitude of the unbalance and to the square of is angular speed.

EXAMPLE 3.2 
 
An exciter consisting two mass elements of mass, m, rotating in opposite directions is mounted 
on a machine of mass, M, supported by springs as shown in Figure 3.17. By changing the 
rotational velocity, the resonant amplitude was measured as 0.06 cm. When the rotational 
velocity of the elements is increased beyond the resonance frequency, the amplitude becomes 
and remained at 0.08 cm. Determine the damping factor of the system.

Forced Response / Damped System / BASE MOTION 
 
In most cases, the motion of the support excites a dynamic system. Consider the mass-spring-
dashpot system of Figure 3.18 (a). The spring and dashpot are in parallel with one end of each 
connected to the mass and the other end of each connected to a moveable support. Let y(t) 
represent the known displacement of the support and let x(t) represent the absolute displacement 
of the mass.

Substitute the relative displacement (dependent variable) of the mass (system) to its support; 
 
 
Þ 
z(t)     = 
x(t)  –  y(t)

           ………(3.32) 
 
 
where y(t) = Y.sin(wext) is the simple harmonic motion form of the base (support) displacement. 
 
 
Dividing Equation (3.39) by m gives, 
 
 
Þ 
     =

Equation (3.33) shows that a mass-spring-dashpot system subject to harmonic base motion is 
another instance in which the magnitude of a harmonic excitation is proportional to the square 
of its frequency. The form of this equation is somewhat similar to that of Equation (3.23) except 
that the variable z and mw2Y replace x and mew2, respectively. Therefore, the solution of 
Equation (3.33) is given by: 
 
Þ

3.8 
Vibration Isolation  
 
Unwanted vibrations may be induced by large impulsive forces in machines such as hammers 
and presses; unbalanced reciprocating components such as engines, motors (examples?); 
resonance effects caused by recurring wind loading on structures or fluid flow in pipes. As you 
are aware, the major objective of vibration analysis knowledge is to apply its results (by 
understanding its physical significance) to understand how unwanted or excessive vibrations 
can be reduced or eliminated. 
 
Vibration control is the use of vibration analysis - 
To develop methods to reduce or eliminate unwanted vibrations, or 
To use vibrations to protect against unwanted force or motion transmission. 
 
Though it may not be in the scope of this course (MEC521), it is worthwhile to look into the 
important methods to control excessive vibrations: 
 
(a) 
Control of the Excitation Magnitude or Frequency 
 
–  
reduce the magnitude of the unbalance / rotational speed 
– 
change the excitation frequency 
– 
check the frequency response curve to determine the acceptable steady-state 
amplitude 
 
(b) 
Control of System Parameters 
– 
The response of a system is a function of the system’s inertia, stiffness and 
damping parameters. A change in any parameter causes a change in steady-
state amplitude. 
 
(c) 
Control of System Configurations 
– 
A suitable example is addition of vibration absorber into the system of concern 
to alter the natural frequency of the system so that is will not coincide with the 
excitation frequency 
 
(d) 
Reduction of Force / Motion Transmission 
– 
This usually refers to the use of vibration isolator between two components of 
a mechanical system. An isolator can reduce the transmission of (repetitive) 
force

4.1 
Introduction 
 
The analysis of vibrating systems in the previous lesson has been limited to systems with one 
degree of freedom (SDOF). That means the motion of the system can be completely described 
by only one coordinate variable. SDOF systems thus have one natural frequency. 
 
However, in the real world, many engineering systems or assembly of components have several 
degrees of freedom and hence several natural frequencies. The simple most form of a multi-
DOF system is the two DOF (2-DOF) system. Figure 2 shows some examples of 2-DOF system 
models. These systems require two independent displacement variables, e.g. y1 and y2, to 
describe their motions. 2-DOF systems will have two modes (pattern) of motion and two 
natural frequencies, w1 and w2. It follows that a three DOF system will have three displacement 
variables, and would have three modes of motion and three natural frequencies. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.1 Examples of 2-DOF systems. 
 
This chapter deals with the analysis of free and forced vibrations of two DOF systems. 
Analytical approaches to examining the motion of the systems and the corresponding two 
natural frequencies will be elaborated. The same form of analysis can be used for systems with 
more than two DOF, however, the analysis entails many simultaneous equations and these 
systems are usually evaluated by using computer programs or packages such as ‘finite element 
analysis’. The analytical techniques developed in this chapter will provide you with further 
understanding of vibrating systems and their modes of motion. 
 
 
4.2 
Free Vibration Analysis using FBD Method 
 
We will use a simple two-mass and two-spring system to represent a linear system for this 
analysis. The springs represent elastic elements and the masses characterize the inertia in the 
system. Damping will not be included in the analysis since this would make the equations of 
motion more complex to solve. It should be noted that damping does modify the frequency of 
vibration slightly. The following analysis will be divided into two parts including determination

4.2.1 
Determination of natural frequencies 
 
Let us now consider the model of the 2-DOF system represented in Figure 4.2(a). This entails 
two FBD, one for each mass component of the system, M1 and M2, when they are displaced and 
vibrating, as shown in Figure 4.2(b). Take note that the net displacement of spring k2 is x2 – x1 
assuming x2 > x1, which MUST be stated in the FBD.

Figure 4.2(b) 
 
 
The instantaneous displacements for the masses are represented by x1 and x2. These 
displacements will vary with time and assuming the system to be vibrating in harmonic motion, 
they can be represented by: 
 
 
 
where X1 and X2 are the amplitudes of vibration of the two masses at wn, which can be either w1 
or w2. That is, the system – comprising the two masses as a whole – vibrates either at w1 or w2 
at any given time. So, we will have a set of x1 and x2 for w1 and another set of x1 and x2 for w2. 
We shall now proceed to determine the two natural frequencies first. 
 
From the FBD, the equations of motion for the two masses can be derived as follows.

Since the system is assumed to be vibrating in simple harmonic motion, 
 
 
 
      and  
 
 
then 
 
      and  
 
 
or 
 
 
      and  
 
 
Substitution into Equations (1) and (2) gives: 
 
 
           
 
 
 
or 
 
 
 
 
 
       ……(3) 
 
and 
      
 
 
 
 
 
       ……(4) 
 
Equations (3) and (4) can be represented in matrix form as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
When the system is vibrating, the values of x1 and x2 will be continuously changing with time. 
It follows that the displacement matrix 
 cannot be zero, therefore the 2 ´ 2 ‘system matrix’ 
must be zero, or in other words, the determinant must be zero. Solving this determinant gives: 
 
 
 
                
 
 
or 
 
 
 
       ……(5) 
 
 
Equation (5) is a quadratic equation and its roots can be determined using the standard solution 
for a quadratic equation. It can be shown, by substitution of z = 𝜔!" into Equation (5), that: 
 
 
 
 
This solution for wn results in two values for the natural frequency of vibration for the system, 
i.e., w1 and w2. The lower value, w1, is called the first or fundamental natural frequency, and 
the higher value, w2, is called the second natural frequency or first harmonic.

4.2.2 
Determination of mode shapes at w1 and w2 
 
The amplitude ratio (or displacement ratio), that describes the pattern of vibration (called mode 
shape), can be found from the equations of motion. It can be seen from Equation (4) that, 
 
 
or 
                         ……(7) 
 
A different expression would be obtained from Equation (3), but upon substitution for all the 
parameters, the values for x2/x1 should be the same as obtained from the above expression. From 
Equation (3): 
 
        or       
 
  
It will be shown (see Example 4.1 below) that when the system is vibrating at the lower natural 
frequency (w1), both masses will be moving in the same direction at all instances in time. This 
will result from the displacement ratio having a positive value. At the higher or second natural 
frequency (w2) of vibration, the displacement ratio will be negative, indicating that the masses 
move in opposite directions at all instances in time. 
 
 
EXAMPLE 4.1 
 
Consider a two mass spring system as shown below in Figure 4.3. If k1 = k2 = k = 8 MN/m 
and M1 = M2 = M = 500 kg, 
 
1. determine the two natural frequencies of vibration for the system, 
2. determine the respective displacement ratios at each frequency, and 
3. sketch the form of the displacements (mode shapes) for each mass when the system is 
vibrating at each of the two natural frequencies.

2. DISPLACEMENT RATIOS AT EACH NATURAL FREQUENCY 
 
The displacement ratio for the system, when it is vibrating at each of the two natural 
frequencies, can be evaluated using Equation (7) as follows: 
 
 
 
At 
:  
 
or 
 
 
At 
:  
 
x2
x1 = – 0.618     or 
 x2 = – 0.618x1 
 
As stated earlier, this result shows that the displacements of M1 and M2 are in the same direction 
when the system is vibrating at 
 (78.17 rad/s) and in opposite directions at 
(204.66 rad/s). 
 
 
3. MODE SHAPE AT EACH NATURAL FREQUENCY 
 
The two modes of vibration are illustrated below. Mode 1 corresponds to pattern of vibration 
(i.e., relative position of M1 and M2) at 
, and Mode 2 at 
. The amplitude ratios shown in 
these mode shapes should be considered as a snap shot in time of the displacements, since they 
will vary with time, but their form will be the same. 
 
 
 
 
The term mode describes the relative motion of the two masses. The absolute displacements of 
the masses cannot be determined since no information is provided relating to how the system 
may be forced to vibrate. For instance, in Mode 1, when mass M1 undergoes a unit displacement 
(say, 1 cm) to the right, mass M2 undergoes 1.618 of the unit displacement (1.618 cm) in the 
same direction. In Mode 2, when M1 undergoes a unit displacement to the right, M2 undergoes 
0.618 of that unit displacement but to the left (the negative sign denotes opposite direction).

4.3 
Derivation of EOM using Lagrange’s Equation 
 
As seen above, the FBD is one approach to deriving the equation of motions (EOMs) of a 2-
DOF system. The Lagrange method is an alternative approach to deriving the EOMs. This 
method is pertinent to the kinetic (T) and potential (V) energies of the system at an arbitrary 
instant. T and V are functions of n number of generalized coordinates, x. The lagrangian, L is 
defined as 
 
  L = T – V.                                                      ……(8) 
 
The Lagrange’s equations are given by

where Fi is the non-conservative generalized force corresponding to the ith generalized 
coordinate xi, and 𝑥̇# is the first time derivate of xi (i.e. generalized velocity). Take note that the 
generalized coordinate does not have to be x (linear displacement) all the time; it can be also q 
(angular displacement) depending on the given system and loading conditions. 
 
Equation (9a) or (9b) represents a system of n differential equations with every ith equation 
corresponding to each of the n generalized coordinates. Equation (9a) or (9b) thus can be used 
to derive the equations of motion of a 2-DOF system.

system shown Figure 4.5 using q1 and q2 as generalized coordinates.

4.4 
Forced vibration analysis of a 2-DOF system 
 
In this section, we shall examine the effects of a forcing function, F(t) with an excitation 
frequency w, applied to one of the mass elements in a 2-DOF system. The objective of analysis 
in this part is to determine expressions for X1 and X2. Every system will need to have its 
equations of motion developed in order to evaluate displacement amplitudes, X. 
 
Consider the 2-DOF system shown earlier in Figure 4.2(a), but now with an externally applied 
harmonic force, F sin(wt), acting on M1 as shown in Figure 4.7(a). 
 
 
 
 
 
                                Figure 4.7(a)  
 
                   Figure 4.7(b) 
 
 
It can be shown, using the FBD method, that the EOM for each mass is as follows. 
 
Mass M1: 
 
               
     ……(10) 
 
Mass M2: 
 
 
   
 
                               ……(11) 
 
 
You will remember that when a system is acted upon by a harmonic force at a specific excitation 
frequency, w, the system will respond by vibrating at that excitation frequency (i.e., no more at 
its own natural frequencies). Hence, assuming a harmonic response of the form X sin(wt),

Substitution into Equations (10) and (11) gives: 
 
 
 
        
  
 
                  ……(12) 
 
and 
 
 
   
 
 
 
     ……(13) 
 
Note: The sin(wt) term will originally appear in all terms in the equations, and so have been 
cancelled in Equations (12) and (13). 
 
 
Rearranging Equations (12) and (13) in Xl and X2 gives two simultaneous equations as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     ……(14) 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
     ……(15) 
 
 
Solving the above two simultaneous equations gives the expressions for the amplitudes as: 
  
 
 
 
 
 
     ……(16) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     ……(17) 
 
 
Thus, the response (amplitude) of each mass, X1 and X2 , can be determined for each mass, M1 
and M2, respectively, in terms of the magnitude of excitation force F and excitation frequency 
w. 
 
It needs to be recognised that this 2-DOF system will still have two natural frequencies, w1 and 
w2, which can be calculated using Equation (6). If w  is close to either of these two natural 
frequencies, then resonance will occur.

Consider the system shown in Example 4.1 where, 
 
k1 = k2 = k = 8 MN/m   and   M1 = M2 = M = 500 kg 
 
that has the following two natural frequencies

If an excitation force of magnitude 2000 N is applied to mass M1, determine the amplitudes of

Final substitution of the above interim results into the expression for X1 and X2  yields: 
 
 
w  (rad/s)

0.38 
0.048 
1.5 
X2 (mm) 
0.45 
– 0.213 
– 1.0 
 
Discussion: 
 
It can be seen from these results that at w = 50 rad/s, masses M1 and M2 are vibrating in phase 
(same signs) with amplitudes of 0.38 and 0.45 mm, respectively. This is below the first natural 
frequency of the system (w1 = 78.17 rad/s). For w = 140 rad/s, which lies between w1 and w2, 
X1 is very low at approximately 0.05 mm whilst X2 = 0.213 mm but heading to the opposite 
direction of X1 (negative sign). At w  = 200 rad/s, which close to the second natural frequency 
(w2) of 204.66 rad/s, both amplitudes are high at 1.5 and –1 mm, respectively. Thus for                     
w = 140 rad/s and w = 200 rad/s, the masses vibrate out of phase (opposite directions) to each 
other.

4.5 
Dynamic vibration absorber 
 
We have seen that for a 2-DOF system subjected to a harmonic force, it is possible to have zero 
displacement of the first mass M1, even though there is an excitation force being applied directly 
to it. A quick inspection of Equation (16) will reveal that it is theoretically possible to make    
X1 = 0 by making the numerator of the RHS of the equation zero. 
 
In this case, the applied excitation force, F, is directly balanced by a force – resulting from the 
vibration of the second mass M2 – that is exerted onto the first mass through spring k2. The 
excitation force applied to M1 is thus ‘absorbed’ by the second mass M2 and spring k2. 
 
This gives us the opportunity to control the amplitude of vibration of an existing SDOF system 
(primary; M1 and k1) by adding a second set of mass and spring (secondary; M2 and k2) that 
converts the original 1-DOF system effectively into a 2-DOF system. The secondary system is 
called “dynamic vibration absorber”. Figure 4.8 (a) and (b) explains this.

As mentioned above, inspection of Equation (16) shows that X1 will have a zero value when
. That is, X1 = 0 when the values of spring stiffness (k2) and second mass (M2) are 
chosen such that their ratio is identical to the excitation frequency, w. In this case,

WORKSHEET (4.3) 
 
A machine has a total mass of 800 kg and is mounted on supports which provide a total vertical 
stiffness of 12 MN/m. When the machine is operating at its design speed of 1200 revs/min, it 
is found to vibrate at an unacceptable level. 
 
(a) Investigate the possible reason for this level of vibration. 
 
It is proposed to reduce the vibration by fitting a spring and mass, to act as a dynamic vibration 
absorber.  
 
(b) If the absorber mass is to be 50 kg, determine the stiffness of a suitable spring. 
 
(c) If the amplitude of the excitation force is 700 N, determine the amplitude of vibration of the 
absorber mass when the machine is operating at its design speed. 
 
(d) Determine the two natural frequencies of vibration for the machine with the absorber fitted.  
 
(e) Comment on the suitability of this particular solution for reducing the amplitude of 
vibration. 
 
 
 
Answers:   
(a) Hint: Compare excitation frequency and the natural frequency of the primary system. 
(b) k2 = 7.89 ´ 105 N/m 
(c) X2 = 0.887 ´ 10–3 m 
(d) w1 = 109.3 rad/s, w2 = 140.9 rad/s 
(e) Hint: We have found only a mathematical solution to this vibration issue. w1 and w2 are 
still quite close to w. It is advisable to have w1 and w2 at least 20% away from w. If the values 
of k2 and M2 to achieve X1 = 0 are found to be unrealistic via analytical solution, then adding 
the secondary system is not a good solution. So suggest one way how to absorb the 
(amplitude of) vibration of the primary system other than adding the secondary system.

Free vibration analysis of a 2-DOF system: Normal mode solution approach 
 
In Section 4.2 above, we have seen how a 2-DOF system under free vibration is analysed and 
its natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained. In this section, we will explore another 
approach to obtaining the same quantities called the normal mode solution. This approach 
utilizes matrix analysis but slightly different than that presented on p. 4 above. Let’s explore! 
 
 
4.6.1 
Definition of “normal mode” 
 
Consider a 2-DOF system as shown in Figure 4.9 
(similar to Figure 4.2(a)). Normal mode refers to a state 
of motion when masses M1 and M2 are oscillating in such 
a manner that they reach their respective maximum 
displacements (X1 and X2) simultaneously and also pass 
their respective SEPs simultaneously, i.e. at the same 
time in every oscillation.  
 
In short, this state of motion can be described as follows: 
 
All bodies of interest in the system are vibrating                  
in phase at one frequency*.  
 
*both masses vibrate either at w1 or w2 at a given time 
 
 
 
 
                      Figure 4.9 
 
 
4.6.2 
Steps to obtain natural frequencies (w1 and w2) 
 
Step 1:  Obtain the EOMs (either through FBD or Lagrange’s method) 
 
 
Example: Refer Equations (1) and (2) on p. 3 above. 
 
Step 2:  Rewrite the EOMs in Step 1 by grouping the principal coordinates, x1 and x2 and their 
second derivatives as follows: 
 
Example: 𝑀#𝑥̈# + (𝑘# + 𝑘$)𝑥# −𝑘$𝑥$ = 0 
 
  𝑀$𝑥̈$ −             𝑘$𝑥# + 𝑘$𝑥$ = 0 
 
Step 3:  Transform the above rewritten EOMs to a  matrix of the following standard form: 
 
 
[M]{𝑥̈} + [K]{𝑥} = [0] 
 
Example: .𝑀#
0
0
𝑀$/ 0𝑥̈#
𝑥̈$1 + .𝑘# + 𝑘$

𝑥$3 = 0

𝑀$/ 
 
and  
stiffness matrix, [K] = .𝑘# + 𝑘$
−𝑘$
−𝑘$
𝑘$ / 
SEP of M1 
SEP of M2 
 
The b and c elements in the 
stiffness matrix are usually 
the same. If your terms for b 
and c are different, it’s best 
you check your EOMs 
through again.

                        19 
Step 4: In the normal mode solution approach, natural frequencies (w1 and w2) are called 
“eigenvalues”.  
 
For the purpose of the following analysis, w1 and w2 are collectively written as wn with 
n = 1 and 2. 
 
The eigenvalues are calculated from the following equation: 
 
det | [K]  –  l[M] | = 0 
 
where,  l = 𝜔!"   (this is a temporary substitution to ease calculation) 
 
Prerequisite knowledge:  Matrix operations 
You need to know how to get the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix. 
 
 
Example:   [K] – l[M] = .(𝑘# + 𝑘$) −𝑀#𝜆
−𝑘$
−𝑘$
𝑘$ −𝑀$𝜆/ 
 
               det | [K] – l[M] | =  5(𝑘# + 𝑘$) −𝑀#𝜆6 (𝑘$ −𝑀$𝜆) −(−𝑘$)(−𝑘$) = 0  
 
                           =  𝑀#𝑀$𝜆$ −(𝑀#𝑘$ + 𝑀$𝑘# −𝑀$𝑘$)𝜆+ 𝑘#𝑘$ = 0  
 
Equation («) is a quadratic equation and comparable to Equation (5) on p. 4 above. 
Thus by solving for l, we can obtain the expressions for the two natural frequencies, 
l1 and l2 (i.e., w1 and w2) identical to Equation (6).

4.6.3 
Steps to obtain mode shape vectors ({Xi}) 
 
Step 1:  Let the mode shape vector, {Xi} = [Xi1   Xi2]T 
 
 
 
where  i = refers to the i-th mode (natural frequency) 
              = 1, 2 for 2-DOF systems (two modes of vibration) 
 
Example: X1 = mode shape corresponding to the first natural frequency (see p. 7) 
  
  X11 = displacement of mass M1 at the first natural frequency, w1 
 
  X12 = displacement of mass M2 at the first natural frequency, w1 
 
 
Step 2:  Use the following formula to determine {X1} for l1 for Mode 1 
 
| [K]  –  l[M] | {𝑿'} = [0] 
 
 
by setting X11 = 1 unit displacement and finding the displacement of X12

4.6.4 
Steps to confirm mode shape orthogonality 
 
Mode shape orthogonality refers to an analytical method to confirm that both the mode shapes, 
{X1} and {X2}, are mutually independent. That is, referring to the idea of normal modes as 
described in Section 4.6.1, the values of amplitudes of masses M1 and M2, and their timing of 
passing by their SEPs (phase) are unique to the specific natural frequency they are vibrating at.  
 
Meaning, there will be one set of values of X1 and X2 (for M1 and M2) and phase of vibration 
exclusive to w1, and another set of values  of X1 and X2 (for M1 and M2) and phase that is 
pertinent to w2. 
 
Step 1:  Prove the following 
 
{𝑿*}([𝑴]{𝑿+} @ 0 
 
 
 
If the LHS matrix operation results in zero or near zero value, then the mode shapes are mutually 
orthogonal. Otherwise (if non-zero), it implies that the mode shapes are not orthogonal.

5.1 
Introduction 
 
In the study of vibrations, so far we have concentrated on discrete systems, i.e., systems that 
have a number of mass elements and stiffnesses. In the previous chapter, we looked at systems 
with two degrees of freedom (DOF) and it was stated that systems can have many DOF and 
hence many natural frequencies of vibration. In this chapter, we will look at a particular type 
of vibration, where the system may have many natural frequencies that can be evaluated by 
using an alternative method based upon energy conservation called the Dunkerley’s method. 
 
The type of beam vibration covered in this chapter is transverse vibration (see Figures 5.1 and 
5.2). A beam-like structure is also referred to as a continuous system. A structure that can be 
modeled as comprising of an infinite number of mass elements and provides stiffness 
throughout its length is termed “continuous”.  
 
An example of transverse vibration can be found in a pedestrian bridge across a river. The 
bridge may start to noticeably oscillate once a number of people are walking along it. This 
resulted because one of its natural frequencies was close to the foot step frequency of the people. 
You should recognize this as a classical problem of resonance. Obviously, modifications to the 
bridge has to be made to control its excessive vibrations. Part of the solution to the problem 
includes fitting dynamic vibration absorbers, which was covered in the previous chapter. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1 This beam (or bar) has the potential to vibrate in the x and y directions as shown 
in Figures 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) below. These two vibrations are referred to as transverse 
vibration since the displacement during vibration is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis z.

A continuous system is called as such because (i) its displacement (along the x-axis or y-axis) 
can be defined continuously along its length (z-axis) of the beam, and (ii) the beam mass is 
distributed continuously along the length of the beam. For an absolute solution of the vibration, 
it would be necessary to consider the beam as an infinite number of connected mass elements, 
each having its own stiffness. This would result in an infinite number of natural frequencies, in 
each form of vibration. The following elaboration is pertinent to the first natural frequency a.k.a 
fundamental frequency. 
 
 
5.2 
Dunkerley’s Method to Determine Fundamental Frequency 
 
5.2.1 
Energy method (Rayleigh’s approach) 
 
The energy method as a general concept was developed by Rayleigh. The method considers a 
vibrating system and the conservation of energy during its vibration. The principle will now be 
developed by consideration of a simple SDOF system and will then be extended to a beam 
carrying concentrated loads. We will first evaluate the strain energy and kinetic energy for the 
system when vibrating. 
 
Consider the simple spring mass system represented in Figure 5.3. The movement from the 
static equilibrium position is defined by x and the amplitude of vibration by X. The maximum 
kinetic energy, Tmax for the system occurs when the mass has its highest velocity, Vmax. This 
will be as the mass passes through the static equilibrium position (SEP) during its oscillations. 
This situation is represented by:

                        4 
The maximum velocity will occur at x = 0, giving 
 
 
 
The maximum kinetic energy is therefore, 
 
 
 
The maximum strain (potential) energy will occur when the mass is at its extreme displacement 
from the equilibrium position, with maximum extension of the spring. This is represented by 
 
 
 
Now, based upon energy conservation, Rayleigh stated that there must be a continual transfer 
(or transform) of energy from one state to the other as the system vibrates, i.e. strain to kinetic 
to strain etc. continuously. Taking the two extremes above and equating the conditions gives: 
 
  
 
      
  
     
 
You will recognise this as the term for the natural frequency for the system, as previously 
evaluated from Newton’s laws and consideration of the free body analysis in Chapter 2. This 
does show that the energy method is a valid means of analysing vibration. 
 
 
5.2.2 
Energy method applied to loaded beams 
 
Consider a simply supported beam having a number of concentrated masses along its length as 
shown in Figure 5.4. Under these concentrated loads (and ignoring the mass of the beam itself 
for the moment), the beam would sag. If the beam is now disturbed in such a way that it vibrates 
freely, the form of the vibration will be similar to the initial statically deflected form. Let us 
now consider the kinetic energy and the strain energy for the beam, as it vibrates.

Let us consider the static deflection under each mass m to be y and the amplitude of vibration 
to be represented by a, where a is a multiple of the static deflection, 
 
 
 
The total maximum kinetic energy is given by, 
 
 
 
The maximum strain energy is given by, 
 
 
 
, 
, 
 
 
and since 
 
 
 
Equating the strain and kinetic energies gives, 
 
 
 
 
and thereby the following expression for fundamental (first natural) frequency: 
 
 
 
 
It can be seen from this expression that if the static deflection under each load (y) can be 
determined, then it should be straight forward to evaluate the frequency of vibration. It should 
be pointed out at this stage, that the resulting frequency is based upon the assumed static 
deflection form. There are two methods to evaluate the static deflection y including the 
Macauley’s method and Dunkerley’s method. For the purpose of this syllabus, we shall 
concentrate on the latter. 
 
 
5.2.3 
Dunkerley’s method and formula 
 
This method is a very useful for determining the transverse frequency of vibration of beams 
carrying concentrated masses. It utilises the concept of superposition, as will be explained next.

Consider the beam carrying three concentrated loads as shown in Figure 5.5 below. The 
technique involves considering the beam subjected to each load separately. In each case this 
means that the beam will deflect due to the single load and the beam has provided stiffness at 
the loaded position.

In this aspect of the analysis, we shall use d to represent the deflection under each load 
separately. It should be recognised that d is going to be different than y, employed in the 
previous energy method discussion, since we are now only determining the deflection at each 
load as a result of that single load. (In the energy method, all loads were acting in the 
determination of the y values.) Figures 5.6 (a), (b) and (c) above represent the beam deflecting 
as a result of each load being applied separately and in isolation.

Since for a single load there will be a unique beam stiffness, the natural frequency of the loaded 
beam, for the single mass, can be determined. This is repeated for each load and the unique 
stiffness associated with it. Once all the frequencies for each individual load have been 
determined, the transverse frequency for the beam, carrying all loads simultaneously, is 
evaluated from: 
 
 
 
The stiffness of the beam, at each load, can be represented by k1, k2 and k3 respectively. Now, 
since stiffness is defined as force per unit displacement: 
 
, 
, 
 
 
Hence, considering each load in turn (as in Figures 5.6 (a), (b) and (c)) the natural frequencies 
for the beam under each single load are: 
 
, 
, 
 
 
and substituting for k gives, 
 
, 
, 
 
 
These represent the transverse frequencies of vibration for the beam, when loaded with each 
mass separately. In each case these are the fundamental frequencies. It can be seen that 
substitution into the reciprocal frequency equation 
 
 
 
 
 
So if the deflections under each load, for that load acting in isolation, can be determined, then 
the fundamental transverse vibration for the beam can be evaluated for the condition of all loads 
applied. 
 
These deflection, due to each single load, could be determined using beam theory or Macauley’s 
method (as mentioned in Section 5.2.2). However, since there is only one load in each case and 
we only need the deflection, d under that load, there are a set of convenient equations that may 
be used to assist us. These equations, in their most general form for some common beam loaded 
situations, are given in Table 5.1.

EXAMPLE (5.1) 
 
 
  
 
Determine the fundamental frequency of transverse vibration for the beam shown above using 
the Dunkerley’s method. The second moment of area for the beam section is 2.25 ´ 10–4 m4 and 
the modulus of elasticity for the beam material is 210 GN/m2. 
 
Solution 
 
Consider the two loads applied independently, as illustrated below: 
 
 
 
  
In both these cases, the loads are between the supports. Hence, from Table 5.1, the equation for 
the deflection of a simply supported beam with overhang can be used, even though there is no 
overhang, i.e. c = 0. Either of the equations for  0 < x < a  or  a < x < L  may be used.  
 
Using the first of these, 
 
 
 
Now, in both load cases, we only require the specific deflection at the point of application of 
the load, in other words at x = a. Hence, the deflection is 
 
 
 
(i) In the case of the 300g load: P = 300g, a = l m, b = 2 m, L = 3 m 
 
 
 
(ii) In the case of the 500g load: P = 500g, a = 2 m, b = 1 m, L = 3 m

5.3 
Stiffness Influence Coefficient, kij 
 
For a multi-DOF system (which includes 2-DOF system), the relationship between 
displacement {x} of a mass element at a point in the system due to influence of forces {F} 
acting at various other points in the system can be expressed by using “influence coefficients” 
referred to as stiffness influence coefficients. This entails Hooke’s Law for springs as follows: 
 
{F} = [K]{x} 
 
where  [K] = stiffness matrix (see Section 4.6 in Lecture Notes Chapter 4).  
 
The matrix elements of [K], kij, are called stiffness influence coefficients with the following 
definition: 
 
kij is the force at a point i due to unit displacement at a point j and zero displacement* at 
all other points. 
 
*The displacements are all other points are forced to be zero (no motion). 
 
Consider a 2-DOF system shown in Figure 5.7. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.7 A 2-DOF system with two mass elements and three springs. The case of ki1 is 
illustrated above, i.e. unit displacement given at point u  (j) and forces determined at points 
u and v (i). 
 
 
For the 2-DOF system above, [K] can be thought of as consisting four stiffness influence 
coefficients (i.e., four matrix elements) as follows: 
 
[K] = !𝑘!!

where  k11 = stiffness influence coefficient at point 1 due to a unit deflection at point 1  
k21 = stiffness influence coefficient at point 2 due to a unit deflection at point 1, etc. 
We shall now go through a quick example of determining the influence coefficients for the 
system shown in Figure 5.7 above. 
 
Step 1:  Let x1 and x2 be the displacements of m1 and m2, respectively. 
 
Step 2: Set x1 = 1 and x2 = 0 
 
Step 3:  Apply equilibrium of forces (+¯SF = 0) in association with Hooke’s Law, F = kx 
You need to construct the FBDs first and then apply the above to get the following equations! 
 
Mass m1: k1 = -k2 + k11   
(è) 
Mass m2: k21 = -k2  
 
(ê) 
 
Equations (è) and (ê) give, 
 
\    k11  =  k1  + k2    and    k21  =  -k2 
 
Similarly, it can be shown that 
 
 k22  =  k2  + k3    and    k12  =  -k2 
 
The stiffness influence coefficients obtained above are the matrix elements that constitute the 
stiffness matrix as follows: 
 
[K] = !𝑘! + 𝑘"
−𝑘"
−𝑘"
𝑘" + 𝑘## 
 
It can be seen that k12 = k21. This is pertinent to the Maxwell’s reciprocal theorem, which states 
that force (or deflection) at any point in the system due to a unit displacement (or load) acting 
at any other of the same system is equal to the force (or deflection) at the second point due to a 
unit displacement (or load) at the first point. Hence, according to this theorem, 
 
\    kij  =  kji 
 
 
5.4 
Flexibility Influence Coefficient, aij 
 
The flexibility influence coefficient (labelled as aij) is basically the inverse of the stiffness 
influence coefficient (kji). 
 
Thus aij is the influence of unit force at one point on the displacements at various points of a 2-
DOF (or multi-DOF) system, the relationship between force and displacement is given by, 
 
⇒  
{F} = [K]{x} 
 
⇒  
{x} = [K]–1{F} 
 
\     
{x} = [aij]{F}

Determination of fundamental frequency using aij 
 
As an alternative to the Dunkerley’s formula presented in Section 5.2.3, the following formula 
can be used to determine the first natural frequency (fundamental frequency) of the transverse 
vibration of a beam with two discrete masses (see Figure 5.5 to visualize), or any 2-DOF 
systems:
